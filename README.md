### Summary  
This paper introduces a novel automatic framework (AF) for evaluating the nasal base, which can be beneficial for improving symmetry in rhinoplasty and reconstruction. The proposed AF includes:  

- A **hybrid model** for recognizing nasal base landmarks.  
- A **combined model** for predicting nasal base symmetry.
